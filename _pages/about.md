I am Law and Economics Fellow at NYU. Previously, I was a lecturer at Stanford University and a research fellow at the Stanford Rock Center for Corporate Governance and the Stanford Olin Program in Law and Economics. My research applies behavioral insights to competition policy, business law, and the regulation of the digital economy. I am especially interested in empirically assessing the impact of law and its policy implications. I have formal training in law, econometrics, and behavioral science.

I was born in Santiago, Chile. I lived there until 2015, when I started my grad studies at Harvard. Before moving to the Bay Area, I lived in Mexico City for one year, where I worked as a competition expert for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) conducting a competition assessment of the Mexican pharmaceutical sector.

I have taught seminars on antitrust and law and economics in Chile and Italy. And taught Econ 154/PublPol 106 (Law and Economics) at the Stanford Department of Economics between 2021 and 2024. 

Besides academia, my passions are soccer, hiking, and songwriting.
